Favors “loose coupling”.\nA POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a regular Java object, not bound by any special constraints that are not enforced by the Java language specification and do not require any class path. For Java programmers it serves to emphasize the use of simple classes that do not depend on a particular framework. POJOs are used to increase the readability and reusability of a program.\nMinimize boilerplate code.\nSimplifies data access JDBC. (…)\nAOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) (…)"

It eliminates the heavy lifting of configuration that is required for setting up most Spring-based apps. Developers can jump right in and use Spring Boot without ever having to learn the underlying Spring framework.\nWhat is Spring Boot?"
